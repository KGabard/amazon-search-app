            body: "I’ve been using the AirPods Pro v1 for about 2.5 years. They’ve been pretty solid and consistent, but the other day the left one just started making crackling noises, to the extent where it’s unusable. So my search for the next great set of ear buds began.  I’m firmly within the Mac universe (iPhone, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro), and pretty much every earbud review you read presumptively points Apple users to these. I get it, but frankly I’d never been overwhelmed by the audio quality of my AirPods Pro, and as someone who travels for work the ANC was very mediocre. Additionally, the “seamless connectivity” between Apple devices that all the reviews tout is, in actual practice, quite annoying to me when the airpods automatically and presumptively switch devices without my input.  With this in mind, below are my pros and cons for the AirPods Pro 2:  Pros: - ANC is better than v1. Not as good as the Bose QCII which I also tried, but very solid. I could still slightly hear my wife on conference calls in the other room of our home office (with Bose I heard nothing) but it wasn’t disturbing.  - Connectivity seemed solid. Instant connection to iPhone. I also set up connection with my Windows partition and no issues (some static but I think it was interference from another device on my desk, and not anything to do with the AirPods).  - Same lightweight feel as prior AirPods.  - Nice haptic-like controls for pause, playback, forward, etc. Easy to switch between ANC and Transparency mode.  - Transparency mode was also solid. Not a big deal for me as I’m more interested in blocking out other noise, but I understand that for some this is important.  - Mic was good. Took a couple calls and the other party heard me clearly. Similar experience w v1 airpods.  Cons: - Overall audio quality is very good, but nothing special. I’m mostly saying this in comparison to the Bose; I’m no audiophile but sound on the Bose was just richer, more depth or something. Not sure if the ANC had anything to do with it, but the Bose was just a joy to listen to; the AirPods were good/adequate but again nothing special.  - Controls. In typical Apple fashion, they give you none. Want more bass? Too bad, Apple has already optimized that for you. Treble? Same thing, Apple says just trust us, we’ve got it covered. They do offer controls for switching off some of their other features (Spatial Audio, for example) but it’s a shame that Apple doesn't recognize (or care) that different people have different preferences for EQ settings.  - Case. They’ve added a lot of features to the new case (none of which I really care about) but I’ve never liked how slick the v1 case was, and these are no different. Just a personal preference though; the case is still small and very portable, which obviously trumps texture.  - One other annoyance: No idea why Apple feels that, by default, I need to be sent an alert any time I’m more than 100 feet or so away from my airpods. You can turn this off in the Find My app, but again when I’m driving my daughter to school or whatever I don’t require a notification on where my AirPods are located.  In summary, while I generally love Apple products, I just wasn’t overly impressed by these. To be honest, if I hadn’t stepped outside the box and tried something from a competitor (Bose) then I probably would have been fine with these. Again, there are definite improvements to the original AirPods Pro (if I had to put a number on it I’d say they are 35-40% “better”), and they are way beyond adequate in every way. However, due in no small part to Apple’s approach to sound quality (ie not even providing the user with some basic controls for customization), I returned these.  I will say that one thing I’ve learned through reading dozens of reviews is that each person’s use case is different, and that the best earbuds for one person may be different than for someone else. And in terms of the best “all around” earbuds for Apple users, the AirPod Pro 2, as the professional reviews indicate, may very well be the best fit. However, if you are looking for best in class ANC and sound quality, I’m not sure all will be impressed with these. I certainly wasn’t.",

            body: "I had the 2nd generation AirPods circa 2019. I couldn't believe how much better they were than the wired ear buds that had come with my iPhone. What a difference! And I had some control right on the AirPods. Really cool!  Well, slowly the charging case has been going downhill, and then recently it stopped charging all together. I had a dilemma. Buy a charging case for aging earbuds, or invest in newer/better ones. Since I had a sigfnicant amount of credit to use, I decided to make the leap to the AirPods Pro 2 and couldn't be happier. Here's the lowdown on the major categories.  Fit: 3 stars. The left earbud fits like a charm. But the right one? It never quite feels comfortable, and when I run the ear fit test, it says to adjust the fit or try another tip. Well, I've done that and it still doesn't quite feel right. I don't know why. My right ear looks identical to my left. It's not deformed lol. I don't get it - but I've gotten used to it and it's ok on the right ear, but not great.  Overall Sound: 5+ stars. The leap in sound quality made me think back to when I upgraded from the cheap wired earbuds to my first set of Airpods. The difference between the original AirPods and the AirPods Pro 2 is just as profound. The sound reminds me of a high-end pair of Bose speakers. It well-balanced with a deep, but not boomy base, and beautiful highs that are not overly bright or brassy. I'm listening to the same music as my old AriPods. Only now, I'm able to pick out individual instruments that I didn't even hear on the old Airpods. And the soundstage it creates is astounding. I can not only hear individual instruments, I can detect where they are on the stage! I feel like I am listening to a live performance. If there are a paid of earbuds ever made with better sound at this price, I'd like to hear them. For something so tiny, the sound is off the charts.  Features: 5 stars. The first time I walked with these on, I unintentionally had the noise cancellation on. This is some serious noise cancellation! I had to figure out how to turn that feature off. I couldn't hear cars coming up right behind me. I couldn't hear even the slightest amount of traffic noise, birds, or people conversing within 5 feet of me - nothing. Quiet as a church mouse. But in the right environment, what a great feature. It's easy to toggle it off or you can use transparency which enhances outside sounds. This is how I have it during my walks. I can't be surprised by cars or someone coming up behind me. Some people wish for an equalizer to customize their sound further. I do not share that opinion. They sound so good as is, that tinkering with it seems like a bad idea. I'm ok that it does not have that feature, but others may disagree.  Other: 5 stars. Battery life is excellent, build quality is great. Case is solid as a rock. For Apple users, they integrate so easily with iPhone. Typical Apple product.  Let's face it. This is a lot for earphones. I expected a lot and got it. In fact, the sound exceeded my expectations. If you can afford them, get them. If it's too much for your budget and you want wireless earbuds that integrate easily into the Apple universe, try the non=pro version. I see them on sale for $99 time to time and they are well worth the $99.",

            body: "Okay, so I did put my Sony WFs to work for a year or two, but wow, I really wish I had made this switch sooner.  First, the Airpod Pros fit soooo much nicer and weigh so much less. I was CONSTANTLY pushing the Sonys back into my ears and tried about 3 different ear tips to make it work better, but it was just impossible due to the design and weight. The Airpods feel so secure and much more comfortable.  UPDATE: Ugh, with more active use over a period of weeks now I have to take this back. Sonys were much more capable of an active fit than the Airpods, and now I had to buy a 3rd party wing tip, something I did not have to do with the Sonys (I've even have a few times where my Airpods nearly fell out just doing the dishes!). So I have to take this back, but the Airpods still have a much better weight and utility with capable features that are absolutely stellar (Sony could barely manage volume and the tapping is not fun as you smack yourself in the head). But Apple absolutely needs to fix this for the next gen  Second, utility. With the Airpods I can do volume, siri, noise cancelling and control music playback (skip, play/pause, reverse). On the WFs you can only choose 2 options at a time! Just why? So if I wanted noise cancelling controls, then my only other option was volume or playback controls, which meant I had to constantly go back to my phone and do things. Now with the Airpods I can do it all from the very easy to use earbuds sticks, which are also much easier to control than the smacking of your ear Sony WF approach.  Update: Also, the spatial audio is great and seems to lift music and makes a bad podcast or YouTube video sound much more professional sounding. However, I do feel that some of the EQ is lost doing this and Apple doesn't give you a customized EQ experience like Sony Headphones app to make up for this. So while I feel the soundscape is much better, it loses some audio detail at the same time, though the pros outweigh the cons for me here.  OH also really appreciate that the case has a physical pairing button. Sony does not do this for any of their earbuds as far as I know, and since I only pair a new device every month or so it's a pain to remember what kind of random motion I need to do  Great job Apple, I witch I had gotten these so much sooner  Update: While I still enjoy the Airpods A LOT over the WF's I'm not sure why Apple provides nearly zero EQ customization. I have to admit, the Sony Headphones app provided very nice EQ settings that allowed for tailored listening experiences and thus much nicer listening generally in terms of quality audio. At the moment on my Airpods, I am able to boost the brightness a smidge (or you can choose general or vocal boost, which imo both sound terrible and produce a very compressed sound) but I also want to boost the bass just a smidge but this is impossible -- it's one or the other apparently. Without boosting the highs, you can just barely hear the cymbals in any song. I would like to hear the bass AND the cymbals, and it seems like a simple fix that Sony has already implemented years ago! Also, Apple has a pre-made EQ genre list under Music settings and they are much worse, and some how even more compressed sounding. Disappointing, but still better than the WFs.",

On these hour-long runs, I run at maybe a 9.5 min/mi pace for 45 minutes and then sometimes do intervals for the last 15 minutes, getting up to sub 6 min/mi pace. I use the medium sized tips that come attached to the pods. These are the most stable earbuds that I've used including some Sony buds without stems and some Earfun buds with stems. Those both felt out at times.  Sound transparency mode - excellent - In this mode you hear your environment almost identically to if you weren't wearing earbuds. This mode may be important to you if you want to be fully aware of your surrounding when you run. Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode is easily done by pinch an earbud stem for a second or two.  Comfort - very good - They are very light and fit well. The only thing I've noticed is that my ears itch a little bit. That may be a coincident.  Body thumping/vibrations - I don't know if there's a term for this, but when you wear earbuds that seal the ear, vibrations from your body, like when walking or running, get amplified in your ear canal (not by the speakers in the buds). So that with each step, you can hear a thump of sorts. This is a problem with all in-ear buds, but it seems somewhat less pronounced with the airpods. I don't typically notice the thumping, but it could be a problem for some people.  Volume control - horrible - The volume can be controlled using a stem, but I can't get it to work consistently and typically can't get it to work at all. I use my phone's volume control, which is usually fine. Maybe I just don't have the feel for it, but Apple always promotes how user friendly their products are. Well, volume control needs work.  Sound quality - good - I'm not the best judge here. I listen to podcasts when I run, so sound quality isn't a huge issue. Music does seem to sound better than my Sony buds (but they were 1/3 the price). Spatial audio is kind of cool, when you turn your head the sound changes so that it seems to come from the same direction. That is if you are looking forward listening to music and turn your head to the right, the sound will seem like it's predominantly coming from the left.  Call quality - good - It works like you would expect. My Sony buds for some reason began to cause the person on the other end to hear an echo. I don't know if that was a problem with the buds or the iphone however. That was a big reason I purchased the airpods since I use them frequently for calls.  Noise cancellation - good - Some of the noise suppression comes from the physical isolation from the earbud. However, the actual active noise cancellation does substantially further reduce noise. Constant noised like air conditioners will be almost completely suppressed. Currently, I'm about 10 feet from a dryer. These buds reduce that noise to the point that about the only thing I can hear is the sounds of the clothes (buttons, zippers, etc I guess) bumping around. My guess is that it would be hard for any earbuds to suppress those sorts of sounds because they are unpredictable.",

            body: 'Transitioning from the original AirPods to the 2nd Generation AirPods Pro was like discovering color in a world of grayscale. It’s an upgrade that truly elevates the auditory experience to new heights.  The defining trait of these earbuds is the stunning noise cancellation capability. It’s akin to possessing a magical switch that transforms the surrounding disorder into a tranquil haven in an instant. The sensation of peace and silence this feature offers is unparalleled.  One striking demonstration of its power occurred during a confrontation with a clamorous lawnmower in my backyard. Thanks to the AirPods Pro, the once loud and intrusive motor noise was reduced to a gentle, distant hum. It was an auditory illusion that brought serenity amidst the chaos, making these earbuds a true marvel.  Beyond noise control, these earbuds shine when delivering music. Tunes from Apple Music turn into personal symphonies with the spatial audio feature, where every beat, instrument, and vocal detail is savored. It’s an intimate concert that unfolds right inside your head.  The anticipation of what’s yet to come with these earbuds is thrilling. Apple’s upcoming adaptive firmware upgrades promise to make these already-impressive earbuds even better, transforming them into evolving pieces of technology. The thought of these earbuds continually improving over time is genuinely exciting.  In essence, Apple’s AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are more than just headphones; they are a sanctuary for your ears, a key to immersive music experiences, and an emblem of groundbreaking technology. Their transformative capabilities make them an essential companion in a noisy world, and I’m eager to experience the future enhancements these earbuds will receive. They truly embody a perfect blend of tranquility and melody.',

            body: "My use case for these is as daily wear headphones, particularly while working in an office. I have AirPods Gen 1 and I'm quite fond of them, but I'm also a fan of active noise cancelation. I am a pilot and I've used headsets with active noise cancelation (mostly Lightspeeds) for about 15 years now (I was an early adopter) and I also use electronic hearing protection while shooting. The AirPods Pro 2 are significantly cheaper than aviation headsets but roughly in the price range of shooting headsets so I thought I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into with these - i.e. ear buds that offered an active noise cancelation that was not necessarily useful for hearing protection (they have no rating) but offered something like the active noise cancelation I'm used to from my Lightspeed aviation headset (in noise canceling mode) and something like the noise reduction with voice passthrough that I'm used to from my Sordin shooting headset when in transparent mode.  Noise reduction mode delivers shockingly well. It does a very good job of shutting out ambient noise. Someone watching TV in the background? Significantly muted. HVAC/fan/PC noise? Gone. They're good enough that I'm probably going to wear them in my car since my Apple Watch informs me that my car is a loud enough environment that I'm vulnerable to long term hearing damage (it's a convertible, the exhaust is quiet but there's a lot of wind noise and the top doesn't do much to quiet other people's exhausts) and despite lacking a rating the rubber earpieces offer some passive noise reduction and the active may well be enough to take the edge off the poorly muffled motorcycles that seem to love to pace me right next to my left ear for miles on end.  Update: Not sure whether they’ve quietly updated their algorithms or just adjusted the default tuning in the background, but transparency mode is now usable. It still ought to support volume control, like active electronic hearing protection does. /Update  Transparency mode, on the other hand, is a massive disappointment. The idea behind transparency mode is, essentially, a not-rated-for-hearing-protection version of what you get with a pair of Sordins except instead of passive noise reduction with ambient noise passthrough (with processing to filter out sharp sounds, normalization, and clipping and filtering of loud sounds) and a volume control, so that ambient non-noise sound can be anywhere from significantly muted to amplified enough to cut through a pair of passive ear plugs worn under the electronic muffs. You sort of get a version of that. The AirPods Pro 2 add active noise reduction on top of it. Unfortunately, it's tuned very poorly. The default transparency mode plus \"active transparency\" perform something like what a pair of Sordins does in terms of clipping maximum volume but there's no volume control. You get a volume level that is basically slightly louder than ambient but with maybe some reduction of low range sounds and, crucially, a significant boost to mid and particularly high range sounds. HVAC noise is actually worse in transparency than it is when you're not wearing the AirPods at all. It also has an extremely unfortunate effect on keyboard sounds. A typical keypress is sort of a dull, low, clack. The default transparency settings turn it into a louder, shriller, sharper click. My keyboard, which I never really thought about before, is actually quite unpleasant in transparency mode. In general, the default transparency mode is probably something one would only use for very short periods such as a temporary interaction with someone (e.g. long enough to order coffee). For longer term use it's unpleasant enough that you would simply pull the AirPod out rather than switch modes. This is unfortunate as it largely undermines the entire sales pitch for the AirPods Pro. They aren't something you could put in and leave in with transparency enabled while on a walk with a friend and carry on a conversation with someone while preventing your ears from being hurt by a passing vehicle that's had its exhaust system compromised or wear in the office listening to music and switch to transparency mode to have a conversation with some coworkers. It amplifies background noise (again, keyboards become particularly unpleasant) enough that you're much better off simply taking them out, exactly as you would have with the old first gen airpods.  There are custom adjustments for transparency (inexplicably buried a couple layers deep in accessibility settings rather than in the AirPod configuration menus) and they... help. Sort of. It's possible, with some fiddling (the best settings I found were maximum ambient noise reduction, zero amplification, and darkest sound settings, conversation boost disabled) to configure transparency such that it actually does a much better job of muting unwanted ambient sounds (you can get rid of the HVAC again) and retaining clear voice passthrough and even acceptable music passthrough, but even after spending an hour or so playing with all of the available configuration options I cannot find one that allows me to leave transparency enabled while typing. It just makes keypresses to shrill, sharp, and loud. There's a pretty significant amount of processing power built into these for their tiny size, though, so hopefully Apple will be able to update their algorithm such that you can wear them while using a computer. Honestly, given that Apple sells computers, it's kind of shocking that they were released in this state, but here we are. (It's worth noting that part of my disappointment comes from the Sordins I have being totally usable in similar situations (but lacking bluetooth and also obviously being industrial hearing protection) and I also have a set of Walker's digital hearing protection that does have Bluetooth and is much better at ambient sound passthrough (at half the price) but having disappointing sound if you want to listen to music on them.  tl;dr Buy them if you have an iPhone and want good active noise cancelation in a very compact package with good battery life, and decent sound for music. If you're buying them as something you could wear to get, essentially, some background noise reduction and loud noise reduction in an office setting while still being able to talk to coworkers with them in - their weird tendency to actually amplify certain unpleasant frequency ranges in transparency mode makes them poorly suited for this application.  Update: See Above",
